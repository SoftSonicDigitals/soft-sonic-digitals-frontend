At SoftSonic Digitals, we value collaboration and aim to maintain a welcoming and inclusive environment for all contributors. To ensure smooth collaboration and effective use of Git branching and pull requests, we've outlined the following guidelines:
Branching Strategy

    Branch Naming Convention: Use descriptive and meaningful names for branches. Avoid generic names like "feature" or "fix." Instead, use a format like feature/your-feature-name or fix/issue-number.

    Main Branch Protection: The main (or master) branch serves as the primary branch for production-ready code. Direct commits to this branch are restricted. All changes must be made through pull requests.

    Feature Branches: For each new feature or enhancement, create a dedicated feature branch from main. This isolates the changes and facilitates easier review and testing.

    Bug Fix Branches: Similarly, for bug fixes, create a dedicated branch from main. Use a clear naming convention to indicate the purpose, such as fix/issue-number.

Pull Request Guidelines

    Pull Request Creation: Before creating a pull request, ensure that your branch is up-to-date with the latest changes from main. Rebase or merge main into your branch if necessary to resolve conflicts.

    Description and Title: Provide a clear and concise title for your pull request, summarizing the changes it introduces. Additionally, include a detailed description explaining the rationale behind the changes, any relevant context, and steps for testing.

    Reviewers and Assignees: Assign appropriate reviewers to your pull request. Reviewers should be chosen based on their expertise in the relevant area. If necessary, assign yourself as the assignee to indicate ownership.

    Code Review Etiquette: Be open to feedback and constructive criticism during the code review process. Respond promptly to comments and address any concerns raised by reviewers. Aim for high-quality code that adheres to project standards.

    Testing: Ensure that your changes have been adequately tested and that any relevant documentation has been updated. Provide testing instructions in the pull request description if applicable.

    Merge Approval: Wait for approval from at least one reviewer before merging your pull request. Avoid merging your own pull requests unless explicitly permitted by project guidelines.

By following these guidelines, we can maintain a collaborative and efficient development process while upholding high standards of quality and professionalism.
